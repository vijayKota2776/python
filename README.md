<h1>Python Practicals</h1>

This repository contains all the Python practicals I have worked on. It is designed to showcase solutions to various Python programming questions, demonstrating a range of concepts and techniques. Each solution is organized and commented for ease of understanding.
1. Basic Python Programs
	•	Simple programs to understand syntax, variables, and basic operations.
	•	Topics covered:
	•	Input/Output
	•	Arithmetic operations
	•	Conditional statements (if-else)
	•	Loops (for, while)

2. Data Structures
	•	Programs focused on Python’s built-in data structures.
	•	Topics covered:
	•	Lists, Tuples, and Sets
	•	Dictionaries
	•	Nested data structures
	•	Iterations and comprehensions

3. Functions and Modules
	•	Understanding the use of functions to write reusable code.

4. File Handling
	•	Practical implementations of reading from and writing to files.
	•	Topics covered:
	•	File modes (r, w, a)
	•	Exception handling in file operations

5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
